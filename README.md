        <p1><font face="Segoe Script" color="#4286f4" size="5">Internet consists of inter-connected networks.
            Internet is a worldwide network of computers that use common communication standards and interfaces
            to provide  the physical backbone for a number of interesting applications. Computers on the Internet
            use remote server machine that provides files and device to the user's machine. You can review newspapers,
            magazines, books, listen music, watch movies, play games, keep yourself update to current events, go for 
            online shopping, know more about recipes, airline schedules, railway reservations, send E-mail and much more.

        <h2><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="7"><center>HISTORY OF INTERNET</center></font></h2>
        <p><font face="Segoe Script" color="#ff0602" size="5">The seeds of internet were planned in 1969, when U.S. Department
            of Defence sponsored a project name ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Administration Network). The goal of this
            project was to connect computers at different universities and U.S. defence. Soon the engineers, scientists,
            students and researchers who were part of this system began exchanging hardware and software resources.ARPANET
            started with a handful of computers but it expanded rapidly. In mid-80's the National Science Foundation created
            a new high capacity of network called NSFnet which was more capable tha ARPANET. NSFnet allowed only the academic
            research on its network and not any kind of private business on it. So many private companies built their own 
            networks, which was later interconnected along with ARPANET and NSFnet to form Internet.</font></p>

            <h3><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="lime  " size="7"><center>HOW INTERNET WORKS</center></font></h3>
            <p><font face="Segoe Script" color="#ff0602" size="5">The thing that characterizes the Internet is how data transferred
                from one computer to another. Here's what happens  to a piece of data (eg. a Web page) when it is transferred over
                the internet:
                It is broken up into a whole lot of same sized pieces(called packets).
                A header is added to each packet that explains where it came from, where it should end up and how it fits in with
                the rest of the packets. Each packet is sent from computer until it finds its way to its destination. Each computer 
                along the way decides where next to send the packet. This could depend on things like how busy the other computers
                are when the packet was received. The packets may not at all ake the same route. At the destination the packets are 
                examined.If they are any packets missing or damaged,a message is sent asking for the packets to be resent. This 
                continues until all the packets have been received.
