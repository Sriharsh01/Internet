        <h1> INTERNET AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON INTERNET</h1>
        <h2>INTERNET AND IT'S USES</h2>
        <p1 class="p1">Internet consists of inter-connected networks.
            Internet is a worldwide network of computers that use common communication standards and interfaces
            to provide  the physical backbone for a number of interesting applications. Computers on the Internet
            use remote server machine that provides files and device to the user's machine. You can review newspapers,
            magazines, books, listen music, watch movies, play games, keep yourself update to current events, go for 
            online shopping, know more about recipes, airline schedules, railway reservations, send E-mail and much more.
        </p1>
        <br>
        <h3>HISTORY OF INTERNET</h3>
        <p2 class="p2">The seeds of internet were planned in 1969, when U.S. Department
            of Defence sponsored a project name ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Administration Network). The goal of this
            project was to connect computers at different universities and U.S. defence. Soon the engineers, scientists,
            students and researchers who were part of this system began exchanging hardware and software resources.ARPANET
            started with a handful of computers but it expanded rapidly. In mid-80's the National Science Foundation created
            a new high capacity of network called NSFnet which was more capable tha ARPANET. NSFnet allowed only the academic
            research on its network and not any kind of private business on it. So many private companies built their own 
            networks, which was later interconnected along with ARPANET and NSFnet to form Internet.</p2>
            <br>
            <h4>HOW INTERNET WORKS</h4>
            <p2 class="p2">The thing that characterizes the Internet is how data transferred
                from one computer to another. Here's what happens  to a piece of data (eg. a Web page) when it is transferred over
                the internet:
                It is broken up into a whole lot of same sized pieces(called packets).
                A header is added to each packet that explains where it came from, where it should end up and how it fits in with
                the rest of the packets. Each packet is sent from computer until it finds its way to its destination. Each computer 
                along the way decides where next to send the packet. This could depend on things like how busy the other computers
                are when the packet was received. The packets may not at all ake the same route. At the destination the packets are 
                examined.If they are any packets missing or damaged,a message is sent asking for the packets to be resent. This 
                continues until all the packets have been received.
            </p2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p3 class ="p2">The Internet uses TCP/IP protocol for its functioning. 
                The term "protocol" usually refers to a set of rules that define an exact format for communication between systems.
                For example, the HTTP protocol defines the format for communication between web browsers and web servers.
                <br>
                <br>
                TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol A protocol for communication between computers,
                used as a standard for transmitting data over networks and as the basis for standard Internet protocols.
            </p3>
            <h5>USES OF INTERNET</h5>
            <p4 class="p3">Today individuals, companies and institutions use the internet in many ways as mentioned below:
                Business use the Internet to provide access to comple databases, such as financial databases.
                Private instituitions use the intenet for voice and video conferencing, telecommunication.
                The use e-mails over the internet has greatly enhanced speed of communication between companies among co-workers.
                Media and entertainment companies use internet to broadcast audio and video including live radio and television programmes.
